# Bootstrapping an App Component
### [Angular 2 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular2-fundamentals) Practice Exercise
 

**_Instructions_**: Every angular app starts with an app component and a module.
The app component (app/app.component.ts) and module (app/app.module.ts) have been
created, but the app has not been bootstrapped. Make the necessary changes to this 
app to get it all bootstrapped. To do this you will need to:

1. Declare the app component in the app module (app/app.module.ts)
1. Add the app component as the bootstrap component in the module (app/app.module.ts)
1. Use the platformBrowserDynamic service to bootstrap the module in the package's main executable (app/main.ts)

**_When you're done, be sure to run the Plunk and you should see a congratulations message._**
